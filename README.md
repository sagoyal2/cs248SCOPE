## Overview

We present SCOPE: Small City Of Procedural Elements. We plan to procedurally generate a city and create a user interactive setting that allows them to select various camera paths to follow. We plan on implementing this in WebGL.  

## Quick Start
This project is written in Javascript and WebGL. We expect users to have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

To install:
```
cd cs248SCOPE
npm install
```
To view city:
```
node index.js
```
this will create an [express](https://expressjs.com/) server on your local machine, then in favorite browser go to 
```
http://localhost:${port}/City/city.html
```
